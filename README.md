# Enrique Parra's Portfolio

Hello my name is Enrique and I am learning how to be a **Full Stack Developer with MERN taking the MIT xPRO Course**. Here you will be able to find the projects that I will develop during the course.

## Description

At the moment there are three projects in this repository.
- **Pac-Man**: In this project you will see the Pac-Man moving horizontally across the screen. The animation will change direction if it hits the border of the screen.
- **Eye exercise**: In this project you will find two eyes that follows the cursor over the webpage. It shows you the outcome of how JavaScript was applied to play with HTML and CSS.
- **Bus Tracker**: On this project you will find a real time bus tracker. It tracks the buses that circulate across the MIT surroundings. We make use of an API to track the buses and get real-time data in order to display it in a map.
